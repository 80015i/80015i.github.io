# TO-DO:

- [ ] instead of loading snapsvg as a script, package it with webpack
- [ ] current butterfly graph has nodes wrapped in nested SVGs and 
      paths updated to be relative and have `m 0 0` starts. We should 
      do this in code instead to support graph changes
- [ ] Get gradients to work again
- [ ] Create static/ subdirectories
