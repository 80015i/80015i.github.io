# List of modifications applied to the `nodes.svg` file exported from Figma:
1. added `id="butterflysvg"` to the top-level SVG
2. sorted paths so that solid color paths are listed before gradient paths, instead of being zipped together
3. used `vim-tabularize` to organize paths by whitespace
4. added `neuron`, `neuron_solid` and `neuron_gradient` classes to appropriate paths
